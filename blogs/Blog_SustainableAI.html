        <p class="tags">#AI #Sustainability #Energy</p>

        <article>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence is often seen as an abstract, digital force—floating somewhere in the cloud, detached from the physical world. But behind every AI model lies a complex web of servers, chips, cooling systems, and energy sources, all of which leave a mark on the planet.</p>
            <h2><strong>The Hidden Cost of AI</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Training large AI models requires vast amounts of computational power.</strong> GPT-3, for instance, emitted around 502 metric tons of CO₂ during training—roughly the same as a car driving over a million kilometers. Meta’s LLaMA 3 (70B parameters) consumed nearly four times more than that.</p>
            <p><strong>But the impact doesn’t end with training.</strong> Every time we use AI, there’s an environmental cost. A single ChatGPT query consumes nearly 10 times more energy than a Google search. At scale, this adds up quickly: ChatGPT’s estimated daily energy use could power over 20,000 households per year.</p>
            <p>Importantly, energy and the accompanying carbon footprint are not our only concerns.<strong> The environmental impact goes far beyond this.</strong> For instance, AI data centers consume billions of liters of freshwater annually for cooling—often in regions already facing droughts.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the AI industry contributes significantly to the 53.6 million metric tons of global e-waste produced each year, much of it hazardous and poorly recycled. Not to mention that the chips powering AI rely on rare materials like gallium, indium, and silicon, which require energy-intensive mining and processing. These processes not only pollute but also threaten biodiversity and water security.</p>
            
            <h2><strong>Bringing some nuance</strong></h2>
            <p>Of course, we don’t want to bring the message that everyone who loves the environment should stay away from AI. <strong>When used responsibly, AI models can be remarkably efficient.</strong> <a href = "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54271-x">A recent paper</a> argued that AI is much more efficient for writing than Humans. Generating 100 pages of text with an AI model might use only 0.4 kWh, compared to 10–20 kWh for a human. Similarly, reviewing a million documents might take just 2–5 MWh for AI, far less than the human equivalent.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, <strong>AI also holds tremendous potential to support sustainability.</strong> In energy for instance, AI systems help balance supply and demand in renewable grids, reducing waste and improving reliability. This is exactly what my colleagues of AI lab investigated in <a href = "https://howestailab.github.io/">the EnergAI project</a></p>
            <p>Additionally, AI optimizes processes in sectors like steel and oil and accelerates the discovery of potential materials for green technologies.</p>
            <p>In other words, when applied thoughtfully, AI can be a powerful ally in the fight against climate change.</p>

            <h2><strong>Responsible AI Use Starts With Us</strong></h2>
            <p>The environmental impact of AI isn’t just a developer issue—it’s a user issue too. Millions of unnecessary queries, trivial requests, and redundant tasks add up. <strong>If we want AI to be sustainable, we need to use it responsibly.</strong></p>
            <p>At the same time, tech companies, policymakers, and researchers must work together to reduce AI’s footprint. This includes powering data centers with renewables, adopting more efficient model architectures, and investing in circular design for hardware.</p>

            <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
            <p>AI and the environment are deeply intertwined. On one hand, AI systems are demanding more energy, more water, and more raw materials than ever before. On the other, they are also unlocking new solutions to reduce emissions, monitor ecosystems, and accelerate scientific discovery.</p>
            <p>The key lies in balance. If we are mindful about where and how we deploy AI—and continue to push for greener infrastructure—its overall impact can be a net positive. The future of AI doesn’t just need to be smart. It needs to be sustainable.</p>
