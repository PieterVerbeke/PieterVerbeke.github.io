        <p class="tags">#AI #DigitalHealth #TranslationalResearch #AcademicReflection #Howest</p>

        <article>
            <h2><strong>Transitioning from Theoretical Science to Applied Research</strong></h2>
            <p>In September 2024, I made a big move—from working as a cognitive neuroscientist at Ghent University to becoming an applied AI researcher at Howest. My academic background had always focused on the interaction between human and artificial intelligence. I was fascinated by how insights from cognitive science could help build better AI systems and vice versa.</p>
            <p>But sometimes you have to reinvent yourself in life and in Howest I found the perfect place to do this. When I applied for the job as AI researcher at Howest, I wanted to deepen my technical skills, stay close to innovation, and learn how to translate academic ideas into real-world impact.</p>
            <p>The transition wasn’t without its challenges. Most Howest’s research teams are still in early stages of development. At first, this meant I had to search and find my own way a bit. But I quickly realized that this also came with a unique opportunity: I could help shape the future of these teams.</p>
            
            <h2><strong>Digital Health: A New Direction with Big Potential</strong></h2>
            <p>Quite early on, I found out that there was an initiative at Howest to launch a Digital Health Lab: a research group focused on how digital tools, including AI, can support healthy lifestyles and prevent chronic diseases.</p>
            <p>This mission felt like a perfect fit with my interests in human behavior and technology. I’ve since dedicated my work to exploring human-oriented applications of AI, particularly in the fields of healthcare and wellbeing.</p>
            <p>One project that I worked on is PUW! (Power Up Wellbeing). In this project, we aim to gain a holistic understanding of secondary school students’ wellbeing. We combine subjective data via questionnaires and mobile apps, with objective stress measurements via wearable sensors. Thanks to my background in psychology and data science, I’ve been able to contribute meaningfully to designing the data pipeline and aligning it with both scientific and practical goals.</p>
            <p>Like any research project, PUW! has had its fair share of technical and organizational hurdles. But we’ve made good progress and we have exciting plans in the pipeline. So, stay tuned!</p>

            <h2><strong>The Funding Challenge: Applied Research Is a Different World</strong></h2>
            <p>One of the biggest shifts has been adapting to the applied research funding landscape. In fundamental research, grants are awarded based on innovative ideas that fill in gaps of knowledge. In applied research, funding is more about solving real-world problems in collaboration with industry.</p>
            <p>This shift meant stepping out of my academic bubble of researchers and scientific papers and engaging with entrepreneurs and practitioners. It also meant learning to align scientific ideas with market needs; a skill I’m still developing.</p>
            <p>A hard truth I’ve encountered is that convincing people to invest in preventive healthcare remains a hard sell, despite its massive societal and economic value. But we remain persistent. With several national and international grant applications in progress, we’re committed to pushing this agenda forward.</p>

            <h2><strong>Education: Building the Future of Blended Healthcare</strong></h2>
            <p>Although I joined Howest as a researcher, half of my workload between December and June was in education. Here, I received the task to design a full curriculum for a postgraduate program in eHealth.</p>
            <p>This program aims to educate healthcare professionals in data literacy, digital tools, and AI. As healthcare becomes more digital, we believe it’s essential that professionals feel confident using the tools that can enhance patient care. Of course, healthcare will always be about people first, but technology can be a powerful support system if used wisely.</p>
            <p>Building this program was no small task. In just 7 months, I had to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design a 60 ECTS curriculum</li>
                <li>Align this curriculum with practical needs from the healthcare sector</li>
                <li>Identify the right courses and teachers</li>
                <li>Promote the program</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built and I’m excited to see how many students will join us in the first cohort. Fingers crossed!</p>
            
            <h2><strong>What I’ve Learned—and What’s Next</strong></h2>
            <p>When I started this journey, my goal was to become more technical. However, I’ve only had a few chances to apply my coding skills directly, like building forecasting models in one small project.</p>
            <p>But what I did gain will no doubt provide added value to my career:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A clearer understanding of how to turn theory into application</li>
                <li>Insights into applied research funding ecosystems</li>
                <li>Experience in curriculum design</li>
                <li>A growing network both within and outside Howest, centered around digital health</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In September, we officially launch both the Digital Health Lab and the eHealth postgraduate program. The foundation is laid, and now it’s time to grow.</p>
